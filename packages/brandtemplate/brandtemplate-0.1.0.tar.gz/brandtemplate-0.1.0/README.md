# brandtemplate

A customisable package to automate the creation of [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) presentations using your own brand to display the output of your python based analysis to stakeholders. 

The template uses plotnine and great-tables to create graphs and tables and has themes for both of these that go with the quarto template.

## Customtisation of template

- Fork this repo to create your own master template.
- Update `config.yaml` in `template_config` to update the formatting of the template.
  - If changing the fonts add the new font files into `brandtemplate/template_files/font` and delete the existing files.
  - Change the background and logo image files in `brandtemplate/template_files` to the ones for your brand. This can be copied out of your PowerPoint template and saved as an image.
- Run `python template_config/config_template.py` to update the template based on the changes to your config.yaml
