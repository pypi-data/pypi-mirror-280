## üåü Features

![LLMstudio UI](https://imgur.com/wrwiIUs.png)

1.  **Python Client Gateway**:
    - Access models from known providers such as OpenAI, VertexAI and Bedrock. All in one platform.
    - Speed up development with tracking and robustness features from LLMstudio.
    - Continue using popular libraries like LangChain through their LLMstudio-wrapped versions.
2.  **Prompt Editing UI**:
    - An intuitive interface designed for prompt engineering.
    - Quickly iterate between prompts until you reach your desired results.
    - Access the history of your previous prompts and their results.
3.  **History Management**:
    - Track past runs, available for both on the UI and the Client.
    - Log the cost, latency and output of each prompt.
    - Export the history to a CSV.
4.  **Context Limit Adaptability**:
    - Automatic switch to a larger-context fallback model if the current model's context limit is exceeded.
    - Always use the lowest context model and only use the higher context ones when necessary to save costs.
    - For instance, exceeding 4k tokens in gpt-3.5-turbo triggers a switch to gpt-3.5-turbo-16k.

### üëÄ Coming soon:

- Side-by-side comparison of multiple LLMs using the same prompt.
- Automated testing and validation for your LLMs. (Create Unit-tests for your LLMs which are evaluated automatically)
- API key administration. (Define quota limits)
- Projects and sessions. (Organize your History and API keys by project)
- Resilience against service provider rate limits.
- Organized tracking of groups of related prompts (Chains, Agents)

## üöÄ Quickstart

Don't forget to check out [https://docs.llmstudio.ai](docs) page.

## Installation

Install the latest version of **LLMstudio** using `pip`. We suggest that you create and activate a new environment using `conda`

```bash
pip install llmstudio
```

Install `bun` if you want to use the UI

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Create a `.env` file at the same path you'll run **LLMstudio**

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-api_key"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-api_key"
```

Now you should be able to run **LLMstudio** using the following command.

```bash
llmstudio server --ui
```

When the `--ui` flag is set, you'll be able to access the UI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
