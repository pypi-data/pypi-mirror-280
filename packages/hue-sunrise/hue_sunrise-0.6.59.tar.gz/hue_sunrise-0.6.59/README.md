Enjoy waking up more gently by having your [philips hue](https://www.philips-hue.com/de-de) lights simulate a sunrise.

## Installation

```bash
pip install hue-sunrise
```

## Usage

First register your Hue bridge interactively

```bash
hue-sunrise register
```

Then simply call it with

```bash
hue-sunrise run
```

And view the config using

```bash
hue-sunrise config show
```

If you want to change the configuration use

```bash
hue-sunrise config ip               # IP address of your Hue bridge
hue-sunrise config lights           # lights which should participate
hue-sunrise config scene-length     # how many minutes the sunrise should take
hue-sunrise config afterglow        # how many minutes to stay lit after the sunrise
```

or, if you want to change where the configuration files are stored use the following environment variables

```bash
HS_CONFIG_PATH
HS_LOG_PATH
```


And finally if anything failed an you need to manually switch of the lights use

```bash
hue-sunrise shutdown
```

## Thanks

The beautiful CLI is due to [typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/).
