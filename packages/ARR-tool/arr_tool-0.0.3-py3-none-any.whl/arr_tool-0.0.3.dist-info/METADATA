To execute the Python code on your system, first activate the environment:

1. Open the command prompt in the directory where the Python scripts are stored.
2. Start the virtual environment:
   - Command: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - This creates a virtual environment where the Python libraries used in the scripts are installed.

Files and Their Functions:

- config.json: Contains the paths for the model, and the destination where the predicted Excel sheet needs to be stored.

- updateTable.py: Compares our table's latest awareness date with the latest awareness date of the SQL data and updates our excel sheet 'training_data.xlsx'.
  - Command: `python updateTable.py`

- modelTraining.py: Trains the model on the data prepared in the Excel sheet.
  - Command: `python modelTraining.py`

- generate_prediction.py: Makes predictions for all the data on a specified date.
  - Command: `python generate_prediction.py DD-MM-YYYY`

- outlook.py: Sends the prepared predicted Excel sheet to the designated person.

This forms a cycle where, after some days, the model is updated. First, run `updateTable.py` to load all new data and update the `training_data.xlsx` Excel sheet, followed by model training and other processes.
