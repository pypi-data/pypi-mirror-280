## TiTok - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of TiTok, proposed by Bytedance in <a href="https://yucornetto.github.io/projects/titok.html">An Image is Worth 32 Tokens for Reconstruction and Generation</a>

## Install

```bash
$ pip install titok-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from titok_pytorch import TiTokTokenizer

images = torch.randn(2, 3, 256, 256)

titok = TiTokTokenizer(
    dim = 1024,
    patch_size = 32,
    num_latent_tokens = 32,   # they claim only 32 tokens needed
    codebook_size = 4096      # codebook size 4096
)

loss = titok(images)
loss.backward()

# after much training
# extract codes for gpt, maskgit, whatever

codes = titok.tokenize(images) # (2, 32)

# reconstructing images from codes

recon_images = titok.codebook_ids_to_images(codes)

assert recon_images.shape == images.shape
```

## Todo

- [ ] add multi-resolution patches
