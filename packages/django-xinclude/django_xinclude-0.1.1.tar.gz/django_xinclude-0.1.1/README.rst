Render a template using htmx with the current context.

----

| ``hx-get`` is often used to delegate potentially computationally expensive template fragments to ``htmx``.
  Achieving this sometimes requires more views, each of which needs to inherit from mixins that
  provide access to the same context.
| ``django-xinclude`` provides a template tag that aims to make this easier by leveraging the cache,
  removing the need for the views.

----

Requirements
------------
* Python 3.10 to 3.12 supported.
* Django 4.2 to 5.0 supported.
* `htmx <https://htmx.org/>`__

Setup
-----

* Install from **pip**:

.. code-block:: sh

    python -m pip install django-xinclude

* Add it to your installed apps:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...,
        "django_xinclude",
        ...,
    ]

* Include the app URLs in your root URLconf:

.. code-block:: python

   from django.urls import include, path

   urlpatterns = [
       ...,
       path("__xinclude__/", include("django_xinclude.urls")),
   ]

You can use a different prefix if required.


Usage
-----

Once installed, load the ``xinclude`` library and use the tag passing the template that you want to include:

.. code-block:: html

    {% load xinclude %}

    {% xinclude "footer.html" %}{% endxinclude %}

Every feature of the regular |include|__ tag is supported, including the use of ``with`` and ``only``.

.. |include| replace:: ``include``
__ https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/builtins/#include

You can use the following htmx-specific arguments:

* ``hx-trigger``: corresponds to the |hx-trigger|__ htmx attribute. Defaults to ``load once``.

.. |hx-trigger| replace:: ``hx-trigger``
__ https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-trigger/

* ``swap-time``: corresponds to the ``swap`` timing of the |hx-swap|__ htmx attribute.

.. |hx-swap| replace:: ``hx-swap``
__ https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap/#timing-swap-settle

* ``settle-time``: corresponds to the ``settle`` timing of the |hx-swap|__ htmx attribute.

__ https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap/#timing-swap-settle

"Primary nodes" may be passed along to render initial content prior to htmx swapping. For example:

.. code-block:: html

    {% xinclude "footer.html" %}
        <div>Loading...</div>
    {% endxinclude %}

``django-xinclude`` plays well with the excellent `django-template-partials <https://github.com/carltongibson/django-template-partials/>`__
package, to select specific partials on the target template.

Advanced usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Below is a more complete example making use of the htmx `transition classes <https://htmx.org/examples/animations/#swapping>`__.
Note the ``intersect once`` trigger, which will fire the request once when the element intersects the viewport.

.. code-block:: html

    <style>
    .htmx-swapping > #loading {
        opacity: 0;
        transition: opacity 1s ease-out;
    }
    </style>

    {% xinclude "magic.html" with wand="🪄" hx-trigger="intersect once" swap-time="1s" settle-time="1s" %}
        <div id="loading">
            Loading...
        </div>
    {% endxinclude %}

``magic.html``:

.. code-block:: html

    <style>
    #items.htmx-added {
        opacity: 1;
        animation: appear ease-in 500ms;
    }
    </style>

    <div id="items">
        🔮 {{ wand }}
    </div>

----

You can preload the ``xinclude`` libary in every template by appending to your ``TEMPLATES`` ``builtins`` setting.
This way you don't need to repeat the ``{% load xinclude %}`` in every template that you need the tag:

.. code-block:: python

    TEMPLATES = [
        {
            "BACKEND": "django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates",
            ...,
            "OPTIONS": {
                "builtins": [
                    "django_xinclude.templatetags.xinclude",
                ],
            },
        },
    ]


How It Works
------------
``django-xinclude`` first checks if it needs to render the target template synchronously;
see the `Section below <#rendering-synchronously>`__ for cases where this might be useful.
If this is not the case, it stores the current context and the target template to the cache and constructs a url
with a ``fragment_id`` that targets an internal view. It then renders a parent ``div`` element containing all the
necessary htmx attributes. Once the htmx request fires, the view fetches the cache context and template that match
the passed ``fragment_id`` and uses that context to render the template.

Cache
^^^^^
``django-xinclude`` uses either the cache that corresponds to the ``XINCLUDE_CACHE_ALIAS`` setting, if specified,
or ``CACHES["default"]``.
When setting a new cache key, it finds unpickable values and discards them.
If you want to see which keys get discarded, update your ``settings.LOGGERS`` to include ``"django_xinclude"``
with ``"level": "DEBUG"``.

| All official `Django cache backends <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/settings/#backend>`__ should work,
  under one **important condition**:
| Your cache should be accessible from all your app instances. If you are using multi-processing for your Django application,
  or multiple servers clusters, make sure that your ``django-xinclude`` cache is accessible from all the instances,
  otherwise your requests will result in 404s.

Authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The request user is expected to be the one that initially accessed the original view (and added to cache),
or ``AnonymousUser`` in both cases; otherwise ``django-xinclude`` will return 404 for the htmx requests.
If ``request.user`` is not available, for instance when ``django.contrib.auth`` is not in the ``INSTALLED_APPS``,
then ``django-xinclude`` assumes that the end user can access the data.

Rendering synchronously
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are cases where you might want to conditionally render fragments synchronously (i.e. use the regular ``include``).
For example, you could render synchronously for SEO purposes, when robots are crawling your pages, but still make use
of the htmx functionality for regular users. ``django-xinclude`` supports this, it checks for a ``xinclude_sync``
attribute on the request and renders synchronously if that evaluates to ``True``.
So you can add a custom middleware that sets the ``xinclude_sync`` attribute upon your individual conditions.

See also `Configuration <#configuration>`__ below for the ``XINCLUDE_SYNC_REQUEST_ATTR`` setting.

Configuration
-------------

``XINCLUDE_CACHE_ALIAS: str``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The cache alias that ``django-xinclude`` will use, it defaults to ``CACHES["default"]``.

``XINCLUDE_CACHE_TIMEOUT: int``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The number of seconds that contexts will remain in cache. If the setting is not present, Django will
use the default timeout argument of the appropriate backend in the ``CACHES`` setting.

``XINCLUDE_SYNC_REQUEST_ATTR: str``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The request attribute that ``django-xinclude`` will check on to determine if it needs to render synchronously.
It defaults to ``xinclude_sync``.

Running the tests
-----------------

Fork, then clone the repo:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/django-xinclude.git

Set up a venv:

.. code-block:: sh

    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python -m pip install -e '.[tests,dev]'

Set up the |pre-commit|__ hooks:

.. |pre-commit| replace:: ``pre-commit``
__ https://pre-commit.com/

.. code-block:: sh

    pre-commit install

Then you can run the tests with the |just|__ command runner:

.. |just| replace:: ``just``
__ https://github.com/casey/just

.. code-block:: sh

    just test

Or with coverage:

.. code-block:: sh

    just coverage

If you don't have ``just`` installed, you can look in the ``justfile`` for the
commands that are run.
