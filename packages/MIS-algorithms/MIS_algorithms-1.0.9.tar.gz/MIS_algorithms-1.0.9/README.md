## Overview

This Python package provides efficient algorithms for calculating maximal independent sets in graphs. The project includes various scripts in the `MIS-algorithms` folder, each implementing a different algorithm for computing these sets. The Lotka-Volterra Algorithm and the Continuation Lotka-Volterra Algorithm are both described in the paper "Finding Large Independent Sets in Networks Using Competitive Dynamics".

## Features

- **Lotka-Volterra Algorithm:** Efficient implementation of the Lotka-Volterra algorithm for maximal independent set calculation.
- **Continuation Algorithm:** The Continuation Clgorithm to find maximal independent sets in graphs.
- **Greedy Algorithm:** Implementation of the Greedy algorithm for maximal independent set approximation, where we select vertices based on the minimum degree.
- **Exact Algorithm:** An exact algorithm to find the exact maximal independent set in a given graph. Used much functionality from the PuLP package!

## Installation
You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install MIS-algorithms
```

## Example
```python
import MIS_algorithms as MIS
LV_output  = MIS.lotka_volterra(G, tau=1.1, x0=np.random.random(len(G)))
continuation_output  = MIS.continuation(G)
greedy_output  = MIS.greedy(G)
```

## Usage
To use the package, import the relevant script from the MIS folder based on the algorithm you'd like to apply.

## Configuration
No specific configuration is required.
