# ChordReviewsVis Package

## Overview
`ChordReviewsVis` is a Python package designed to process and visualize review data by generating chord plots. These visualizations illustrate word co-occurrence patterns and sentiment analysis, providing insights into the textual data.

This package was developed by FÃ©lix JosÃ© Funes as part of his master's dissertation at Universidade Nova de Lisboa, which was supervised by Prof. Nuno AntÃ³nio, PhD.

## Installation
To install `ChordReviewsVis`, use pip:
```
pip install ChordReviewsVis
```

## Usage
First, import the necessary libraries and the `ChordReviews` function:
```
import pandas as pd
from ChordReviewsVis import ChordReviews
```

Prepare your DataFrame with a text column containing review data. Then call the `ChordReviews` function:
```
# Example DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv("filepath")

# Generate chord plot
ChordReviews(df, 'review')
```

Some datasets that can be used for this purpose are:

* [IMDB Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atulanandjha/imdb-50k-movie-reviews-test-your-bert)
* [Women's E-Commerce Clothing Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews)
* [Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)

## Function Parameters
- **df** (pandas.DataFrame): DataFrame containing review data.
- **text_column** (str): Name of the column containing the text data.
- **size** (int, optional): Size of the output chord plot. Default is 300.
- **stopwords_to_add** (list, optional): Additional stopwords to include in the stop words set. Default is an empty list.
- **stemming** (bool, optional): Whether to apply stemming to words. Default is False.
- **lemmatization** (bool, optional): Whether to apply lemmatization to words. Default is True.
- **words_to_replace** (dict, optional): A dictionary where keys are words to be replaced and values are the replacements. Default is an empty dictionary.
- **label_text_font_size** (int, optional): Font size for the labels in the chord plot. Default is 12.

## Returns
- **hv.Chord**: A chord plot visualization of word co-occurrence patterns and sentiment analysis.

## Example
```
import pandas as pd
from ChordReviewsVis import ChordReviews

# Generate chord plot
chord_plot = ChordReviews(df, 'review')

# Display the plot
chord_plot.show()
```
