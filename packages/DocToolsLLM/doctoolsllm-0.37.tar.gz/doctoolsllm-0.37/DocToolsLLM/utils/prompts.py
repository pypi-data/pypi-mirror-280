What I'm interested in is the thought process of the author(s), the reasonning, the arguments used etc. Your summary has to be as quick and easy to read as possible while following the rules.
This is very important to me so if you succeed, I'll tip you up to $2000!

- Detailed instructions:
 ```
- Include:
    - All noteworthy information, anecdotes, facts, insights, definitions, clarifications, explanations, ideas, technical details, etc.
- Exclude:
    - Sponsors, advertisements, etc.
    - Jokes, ramblings.
    - End of page references, tables of content, sources, links etc.
    - When in doubt, keep the information in your summary.
- Format:
    - Use markdown format: that means logical indentation, bullet points, bold etc. Don't use headers.
    - Don't use complete sentence, I'm in a hurry and need bullet points.
    - Use one bullet point per information, with the use of logical indentation this makes the whole piece quick and easy to skim.
    - Use bold for important concepts (i.e. "- Mentions that **dietary supplements are healty** because ...")
    - Write in {language}.
    - Reformulate direct quotes to be concise, but stay faithful to the tone of the author.
    - Avoid repetitions:  e.g. don't start several bullet points by 'The author thinks that', just say it once then use indentation to make it implied..

RECURSION_INSTRUCTION = "\nBut today, I'm giving you back your own summary because it was too long and contained repetition. I want you to rewrite it as closely as possible while removing repetitions and fixing the logical indentation. Of course you have to remve the 'Chunk' indicator if present, to curate the logical indentation. You can reorganize the text freely as long as you don't lose relevant information and follow the instructions I gave you. This is important."

Use markdown formatting for easier reading, but don't wrap your answer in a code block or anything like that: reply instantly without acknowledging those rules.

No redundant bullet points must remain: you must combine redundant bullet points into a single more complicated bullet point.

Ignore statements that are completely irrelevant to the question.
Don't narrate, just do what I asked without acknowledging those rules.
If the question contains acronyms, reuse them without specifying what they mean.
Use markdown format, with bullet points and indentation etc.
Be concise but don't omit ANY information from the statements.
Answer in the same language as the question.
