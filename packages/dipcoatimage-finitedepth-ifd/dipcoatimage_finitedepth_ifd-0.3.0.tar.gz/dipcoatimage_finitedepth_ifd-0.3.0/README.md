A [DipCoatImage-FiniteDepth](https://pypi.org/project/dipcoatimage-finitedepth/) plugin to measure roughness with integral FrÃ©chet distance.

## Usage

- Use `RectIfdRoughness` for substrate with rectangular cross section.
- Define your own class by subclassing `IfdRoughnessBase`.

Refer to the documentation for the API reference.

The command-line analysis is also applicable. An YAML example of the configuration file is:

```
data:
  ...
  layer:
    type: RectIfdRoughness
    parameters:
      delta: 5.0
      opening_ksize: [1, 1]
      reconstruct_radius: 50
```

Refer to the DipCoatImage-FiniteDepth package for more information.
