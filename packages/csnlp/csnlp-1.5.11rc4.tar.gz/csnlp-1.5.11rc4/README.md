# Nonlinear Programming with CasADi

**csnlp** provides classes and utilities to model, solve and analyse nonlinear programmes (NLPs) in optimization.

In particular, it makes use of the [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/) framework [[1]](#1) to model the optimization problems and perform symbolic differentiation, as well as the [IPOPT](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt) solver [[2]](#2) (though the package can be adapted to other solvers pretty easily). The package offers also tools for the sensitivity analysis of NLPs, solving them with multiple initial conditions, as well as for building MPC controllers.

## Installation

To install the package, run

```bash
pip install csnlp
```

**csnlp** has the following dependencies

- Python 3.9 or higher
- [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
- [CasADi](https://pypi.org/project/casadi/)
- [Joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

For playing around with the source code instead, run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FilippoAiraldi/casadi-nlp.git
```

## Usage

Similar to CasADi Opti, we instantiate a class that represents the NLP and allows to model its variables, parameters, constraints and objective. A simple example is below:

```python
from csnlp import Nlp

nlp = Nlp()
x = nlp.variable("x")[0]
y = nlp.variable("y")[0]
p = nlp.parameter("p")

nlp.minimize((1 - x) ** 2 + 0.2 * (y - x**2) ** 2)

g = (x + 0.5) ** 2 + y**2
nlp.constraint("c1", (p / 2) ** 2, "<=", g)
nlp.constraint("c2", g, "<=", p**2)

nlp.init_solver()  # initializes IPOPT under the hood
sol = nlp.solve(pars={"p": 1.25})  # solves the NLP for parameter p=1.25

x_opt = sol.vals["x"]
y_opt = sol.value(y)
```

The package also allows to enhance the NLP with different capabilities with, e.g., multistart (see `csnlp.MultistartNlp`) or by wrapping it. As of now, wrappers have been implemented for

- sensitivity analysis (see `csnlp.wrappers.NlpSensitivity`; based on [[3]](#3))
- Model Predictive Control (see `csnlp.wrappers.Mpc`; [[4]](#4) for details)
- NLP scaling (see `csnlp.wrappers.NlpScaling`).

For instance, to compute the sensitivity of the optimal primal-dual variables `y` with respect to the parameters `p` of the NLP , first we need to augment the capabilities of the NLP with a wrapper specialized in differentiating the optimization problem, and then compute the first-order and second sensitivities (`dydp` and `d2ydp2`, respectively) as such:

```python
from csnlp import wrappers

nlp = wrappers.NlpSensitivity(nlp)
dydp, d2ydp2 = nlp.parametric_sensitivity()
```

In other words, these sensitivities provide the jacobian and hessian that locally approximate the solution w.r.t. the parameters `p`. As shown in the examples, the sensitivity can be also computed for any generic expression `z` that is a function of the primal-dual variables and the parameters, i.e., `z(x(p),lam(p),p)`, and computations can be carried out symbolically or numerically (more stable).

Similarly, an NLP instance can be wrapped in an MPC wrapper that makes it easier to build such controller.
