A subclass of Figures, this is responsible for creating
short animations.

create_animations is an interface for this class.

Takes in a list of Data objects. These are just like
regular Data objects, but the dependent variable should
instead be an iterable where each element gives the values
for a single frame.

Currently this is only implemented for Surface objects.

Animate.defaults shows a list of optional kwargs.
