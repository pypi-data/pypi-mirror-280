This function will take in a list of data objects
and produce an animation. These Data objects are just
like regular Data objects, but the dependent variable
should instead be an iterable where each element gives
the values for a single frame.

This is an interface for the Animate class, and to
see a list of optional key-word arguments you can
look at Animate.defaults, Figures.defaults and
Figure.defaults.

This also returns the Figures object produced if
the user wants to work with it directly, but this
is not encouraged, and should only be necessary if
a feature has not been implemented.
