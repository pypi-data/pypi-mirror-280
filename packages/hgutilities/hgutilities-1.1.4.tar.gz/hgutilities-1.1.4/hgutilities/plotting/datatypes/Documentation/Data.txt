This is a general class that gives the data about
a plot. This class is not dealt with directly, and
the user should create one of the subclasses

Lines      For creating line and scatter plots
Bars       For creating bar charts
Pie        For creating pie charts
Surface    For plotting 3d surfaces and contour maps
Colormap   For creating color plots

Information such as what data to plot, title data,
axis labels and settings, and anything else relevant
to the entire plot should be specified at this level.

Data.defaults shows a list of optional kwargs.
