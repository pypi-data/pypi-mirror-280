This is used to create line and scatter graphs and takes in a Line
object or an iterable of line objects. The scope of this object is the
entire plot, and data about individual lines should be specified by
Line objects. Properties such as whether the plot has a legend, what
the title and axis labels are, and the plot type are relevant at this
level. If it does not make sense for two distinct data series to have
different values for a property, then it should be a property of this
object. For more detail, look at the default values for Lines and Line objects.

The plot_type key-word controls which matplotlib plotting function is
used to create the plot. The options are "plot", "semilogx", "semilogy",
"loglog", "scatter", and "errorbar". If values for xerr and yerr are
given for any line object, this will not be detected. The keyword
plot_type="errorbar" needs to be passed in explicitily.

lines.defaults shows a list of optional kwargs.
