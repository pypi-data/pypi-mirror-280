The purpose of this function is to prevent bloated doc strings
at the start of modules, classes, and functions by storing the
doc strings in text files.

By placing "defaults.docs()" in a package __init__.py file, all the
modules, classes, and functions that were imported within that file
that are part of the package will have their doc strings set. The
doc strings are set from text files stored in folders called
"Documentation", and these folders are in the same directory as
the script for the corresponding module, class, or function.
