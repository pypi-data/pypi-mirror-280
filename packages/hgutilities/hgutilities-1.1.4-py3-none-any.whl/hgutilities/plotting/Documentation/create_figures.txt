This function will take in a list of data objects
and produce a set of figures showing them.

This is an interface for the Figures class, and to
see a list of optional key-word arguments you can
look at Figures.defaults and Figure.defaults.

This also returns the Figures object produced if
the user wants to work with it directly, but this
is not encouraged, and should only be necessary if
a feature has not been implemented.
