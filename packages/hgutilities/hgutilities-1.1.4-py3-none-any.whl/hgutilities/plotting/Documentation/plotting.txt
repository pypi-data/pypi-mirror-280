This package is an interface for matplotlib and is designed to make
creation and processing of figures with subplots easier. The data and
settings are specified, and they are arranged on figures where the user
can control the maximum number of subplots on each figure and prescribe
a target aspect ratio. If the subplots do not fit on one figure, they
will be spread over multiple figures. The number of figures is no more
than the ceiling of the total number of plots divided by the maximum
number of plots per figure.

While this package offers a lot of flexibility, it is mainly intended for
convenient production of figures. For publication quality plots, it is
recommended that the full flexibility of matplotlib or other plotting
packages should be used instead. This package performs best for purposes
such as analysing data and making powerpoints to be shared among
colleages and students.
