Responsible for distributing the subplots among figures,
and controlling what happens to the figures, such as whether
they are to be shown, saved, or nothing. The number of
subplots on each plot is controlled by the subplots key-word,
where the default is None (plot all given Data objects).

create_figures is an interface for this class.

Takes in a list of Data objects.

Figures.defaults shows a list of optional kwargs.
