This is the parent plotting class. Whenever anything is plotted, it
will be via calling the create_plot method of this class. Almost all
of the plotting implementation is handled by the subclasses due to
the diversity of types of plot. Takes in a list of Data objects

Plot.defaults shows a list of optional kwargs.
