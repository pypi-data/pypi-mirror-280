Contains information about a single data series on a bar chart.
Anything that affects the entire chart should be specied upon creation
of Bars objects. Almost all features of matplotlib bar charts are
supported, and the key-word arguments are the same. Care must be
taken to enter the key-word arguments in relevant object (Bars
properties not entered into Bar properties and vice versa).

Bar.defaults shows a list of optional kwargs.
