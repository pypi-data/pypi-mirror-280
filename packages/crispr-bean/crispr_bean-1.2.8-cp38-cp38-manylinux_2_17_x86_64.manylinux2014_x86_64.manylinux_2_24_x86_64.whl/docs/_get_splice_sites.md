# Getting splice sites
We provide the utility script to obtain the splice sites if you use the MANE transcript with gene symbol (`--translate-gene-name GENE_SYMBOL` or `--translate-genes-list path_to_gene_names_file.txt`).
```bash
bean get-splice-sites LDLR A LDLR_splice_sites.csv --gene-name
```
