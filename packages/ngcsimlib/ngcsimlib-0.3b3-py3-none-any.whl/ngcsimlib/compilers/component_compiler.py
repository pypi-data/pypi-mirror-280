"""
This is the file that contains the code to compile a component for a command.

There are two primary method provided in this file. The first of them is the parse command. This command is designed
to provide everything that is needed to compile the component down without actually doing so. This is generally used
by the command compiler to produce a working list of everything that is needed prior to the actual compiling of all
components.

The second method that is provided in this file the actual method for compiling the component. This method takes in
the component, the parsed component, and the global argument order for the compiled method. The result of this method
is the execution order needed to be run to compute the compiled method over this component. This execution order is
consistent with the same pattern used by the command compiler.
