### What is NUGU?

Nugu(ëˆ„êµ¬) is a Korean word that translates to 'WHO' in English. It carries a slightly negative meaning and can be used to refer to someone who's not very well-known.

I'm an unknown junior web programmer in Korea. 
But someday, I hope to work globally. Perhaps even become famous.
I might not have the skills yet, but I'll get there eventually. So, as a start to getting my name out there, I made this package. This package will lead you to my blog made with Next.js (not my major, just for fun).

Don't say anything about my blog yet, it's still under construction. You know how tough it is to work on side projects while having a full-time job, right? Just hang tight for a bit.

If you want to get to know me better or be a friend, feel free to reach out anytime - email or whatever works.

See ya ðŸ˜Ž
