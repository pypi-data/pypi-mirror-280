Description: # DeltaCAT
        
        DeltaCAT is a Pythonic Data Catalog powered by Ray.
        
        Its data storage model allows you to define and manage fast, scalable,
        ACID-compliant data catalogs through git-like stage/commit APIs, and has been
        used to successfully host exabyte-scale enterprise data lakes.
        
        DeltaCAT uses the Ray distributed compute framework together with Apache Arrow
        for common table management tasks, including petabyte-scale
        change-data-capture, data consistency checks, and table repair.
