# Documentation

Currently, the documentation is hosted at https://climetlab.readthedocs.io/ and is updated each time the `main` branch is updated.

This may be useful to develop the documentation further: ``sphinx-autobuild docs docs/_build/html``

## Example notebooks

TODO

Always run the notebooks twice before committing changes so that they do not show the data downloads.

## Python examples

TODO

## Inline example plots

To regenerate the plots from the examples, run `docs/generate-examples-maps.py`.
