# No Nonsense

No nonsense is a static site generator. Essential idea is this:

Static Site Generation is a solved problem. All you need is a templating engine

### Features
1. Simple
2. You can do whatever you want

### Problems
1. You need to know HTML, CSS, JS to use effectively

Disadvantage is whitespace is significant in YAML files and tabs vs spaces 
can cause confusion

### Building to package

1. `python3 -m build`
