## Introduction
This project is comprised of 2 modules within the mypackage directory each responsible for handling thier respective features for the game, This project took around 20 - 25 hours to complete including research and experimentation with the pygame framework. This is my first time creating a project of this scale using pygame.

## Features
- Graphical User Interface
- Multiplayer Mode: Play 1v1 with a second player
- Save and Load Games: Your previous game is auto-saved upon quitting 
- Checker Rule Implementation: Game rules are based on international checkers guidelines

## Dependancies
- Pygame Framework handles graphical user interface functionality
- Pillow Library is used for image manupluation and cropping
- Json libary handles python dictionary to json serialization


## Sources
- The render_game_env() method which utilizes modular congruences to asses rows and columns to draw evenly positioned squares is inspired from an article by Sundar Sing - Singh, S. (2017, December 10). [D3: Modulo operation to create a grid.](https://medium.com/@eesur/d3-modulo-operation-to-create-a-grid-f47101831a )
