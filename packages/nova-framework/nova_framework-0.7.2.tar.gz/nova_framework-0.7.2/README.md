### Configuration and usage

To initialize a Nova project, just run `nova init` and follow the instructions:
```sh

Destination location (default: dist): dist/
```

Afterwards, put your [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) and other assets inside your configured source folder.  
To launch a development server, you can run `nova serve --reload` to get a hot-reloading capable web server.
