# grscheller-courses-distribution PyPI Package

Probability distribution classes based on an exercise from Udacity's
Python for AI course.

## Probability distributions completed so far

* class Gaussian from the grscheller\_courses\_distributions.gaussian module
* class Binomial from the grscheller\_courses\_distributions.binomial module
 
## Factoids

* developed using both Python 3.12.4 and 3.10.13 (used by Udacity)
  * Udacity just upgraded the Python they use from 3.6.3 in June 2024
  * 3.6.3 was version of Python out when PyTorch was released in 2016
  * annotations would not have been usable for Python 3.6.3
* using `__future__` statement to import annotations
  * for use by Python std library typing module 
  * annotations targeted for Python 3.13.X
* will eventually incorporate this work into grscheller.boring-math package

## Testing

The testing suite is in the GitHub clone, it is not installed with the
package.

To kick off all tests,

```
   $ pytest tests/`
```

So that the test data is found, run the tests from the root of the clone
of the GitHub repo.
