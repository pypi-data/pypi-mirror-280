# AntPack

AntPack is a toolkit for antibody numbering, data processing, statistical inference and
machine learning for antibody sequences. For usage,
see [the docs](https://antpack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).


## Installation

```
pip install antpack
```

Starting with version 0.2.7, AntPack is distributed as a wheel precompiled
for some platforms and CPython versions, so installation should be very straightforward. If your
platform or Python version is unsupported, pip will install the sdist and
try to use whichever C++ compiler you have installed to compile. This should
still be quite straightforward, but if you encounter any issues, please
report them on the github issues page.

## Capabilities


#### Antibody numbering

Numbering antibody sequences is an important precursor for many statistical inference /
machine learning applications. AntPack is orders of magnitude faster for numbering
antibody sequences than existing tools in the literature (e.g. ANARCI, AbRSA),
while providing >= reliability. AntPack also provides tools for merging lists of
position codes and for easy extraction of specific CDRs and framework regions.


#### V / J genes

Identifying the most similar human V / J gene sequences is useful for a variety of
purposes. AntPack provides tools for determining which human V and J gene sequences
are most similar to the variable region chain provided as input.


#### Humanness and developability

Minimizing the risk of immunogenicity is important for selecting clinical
candidates. In AntPack v0.1.0, we introduce a simple, fully interpretable
generative model for human heavy and light chains that outperforms all
comparators in the literature on a large held-out test set for distinguishing
human sequences from those of other species. This scoring tool can be used
to score sequences for humanness, suggest modifications to make them more
human, identify liabilities, and generate highly human sequences that contain
selected motifs.


#### Finding developability liabilities

Some sequence motifs are known to be associated with developability issues -- certain
motifs are known, for example, to be prone to N-glycosylation or deamidation. AntPack
provides a tool for finding these "liability" motifs in an input sequence. Note that
that identifying liabilities through finding motifs in this way is known to be prone
to false positives (an N-glycosylation motif, for example, will not always be glycosylated).
Still, these kinds of alerts can be useful for making yourself aware of potential
developability issues.
