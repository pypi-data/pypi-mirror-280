# you only glance once

A version of the [YOLO architecture (versions 1 through 3)](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/), optimized for inference speed on simple object detection problems. Designed for the [remoscope project](https://www.czbiohub.org/life-science/seeing-malaria-in-a-new-light/) by the bioengineering team at the [Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub SF](https://www.czbiohub.org/sf/).

Our yogo manuscript is currently in preparation - stay tuned!

## Install

With Python versions >= 3.9 and < 3.11, you can install yogo with `pip`

```console
python3 -m pip install -e .
```


## Basic usage

```console
$ yogo train path/to/dataset-definition-file.yml  # train your model!
$ yogo infer path/to/model.pth  # use your model!
$ yogo export path/to/model.pth  # use your model somewhere else!
$ yogo test path/to/model.pth path/to/dataset-definition-file. # test your model!
$ yogo --help  # all the other details are here :)
```

We're using [Weights and Biases](http://wandb.ai) for run tracking. But, note that you do not need a W&B account to run anything! Runs that are started without an account are logged to an anonymous page. If you do decide to start with W&B, look [here](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart). Anonymous runs can be [claimed later](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/app/features/anon).

Further, we currently only support GPU training, since we use Torch's Distributed Data Parallel.

> [!NOTE]
> Installing Openvino on Apple Silicon is a little involved. [Here is Openvino's guide to installation](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/docs/dev/build_mac_arm.md). You can also use a Linux VM or Docker.


## Docs

Documentation for YOGO. If you want documentation in a specific area, [let us know](https://github.com/czbiohub-sf/yogo/issues/new)!

- [recipes.md](docs/recipes.md) has the basics of using YOGO in your own code
- [cli.md](docs/cli.md) is a short guide on how to use YOGO from the command line (via `yogo`)
- [yogo-high-level.md](docs/yogo-high-level.md) is a high level guide of the YOGO architecture
- [dataset-definition.md](docs/dataset-definition.md) defines the dataset description files, the files YOGO uses to define datasets for training
