# Proxy Server for Pinnacle CLI
This Python server redirects the requests from the Pinnacle CLI to the respective endpoint of the Pinnacle API regardless of programming language. It runs on the `PINNACLE_HOST:PINNACLE_PORT` specified in the .env file. For example if you have `/js_hello_world` JavaScript endpoint and `/python_hello_world` Python endpoint, the server will redirect the requests to these respective endpoint. This is needed since the server runs these two endpoints on different ports.
