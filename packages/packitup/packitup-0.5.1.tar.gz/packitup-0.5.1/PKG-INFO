# PackItUp

PackItUp is a command-line tool that generates a project structure and contents as Markdown. It's designed to help developers quickly document their project structure, including file contents, making it easier to share or review project layouts.

## Features

- Generate a Markdown representation of your project structure
- Option to include file contents or generate a tree-only view
- Handle large files by splitting them into parts
- Copy the generated Markdown to clipboard automatically
- Save output both locally and in the user's home directory
- Color-coded console output for better readability
- List files and directories in the specified path
- Purge all saved PackItUp data

## Installation

You can install PackItUp using pip:

```
pip install packitup
```

## Usage

```
packitup [OPTIONS] [PATH]
```

If no path is specified, PackItUp will use the current directory.

### Options

- `-t`, `--tree`: Generate file tree only (no file contents)
- `-l`, `--list`: List files and directories in the specified directory
- `-s`, `--singlefile`: Ignore file splitting and return as a single file
- `-p`, `--purge`: Purge all saved PackItUp data

### Examples

1. Generate full project structure and contents for the current directory:
   ```
   packitup
   ```

2. Generate only the file tree for a specific directory:
   ```
   packitup /path/to/your/project -t
   ```

3. List files and directories in the current directory:
   ```
   packitup -l
   ```

4. Generate project structure without splitting large files:
   ```
   packitup -s
   ```

5. Purge all saved PackItUp data:
   ```
   packitup -p
   ```

## Output

PackItUp generates two types of output:

1. A local output directory in the current working directory
2. A directory in the user's home folder (`.packitup`)

Both directories contain:
- A Markdown file with the project structure
- Subdirectories for split large files (if any)

The Markdown content is also automatically copied to the clipboard.

## Configuration

PackItUp skips the following folders by default:
`node_modules`, `venv`, `.venv`, `env`, `.env`, `pycache`, `dist`, `build`, `.git`, `.idea`, `.vscode`, `vendor`, `bower_components`, `jspm_packages`, `packages`
