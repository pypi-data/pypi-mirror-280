A package for manipulating and correcting variable point spread functions.

Below is an example of correcting model data using the package. An initial image of a simplified starfield (a) is synthetically observed with a slowly
varying PSF (b), then regularized with this technique (c). The final image visually matches a direct convolution of
the initial image with the target PSF (d). The panels are gamma-corrected to highlight the periphery of the model PSFs.
