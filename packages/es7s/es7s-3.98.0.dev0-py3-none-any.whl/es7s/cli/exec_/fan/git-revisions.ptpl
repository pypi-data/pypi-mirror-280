[[GIT REVISION SELECTORS]]  #[ es7s/core | git revision selectors syntax ]

<rev>
    Include commits that are reachable from <rev> (i.e. its ancestors).

^<rev>
    Exclude commits that are reachable from <rev> (i.e. its ancestors).

<rev1>..<rev2>
    Include commits that are reachable from <rev2> but exclude those that are reachable from <rev1>.
    When either <rev1> or <rev2> is omitted, it defaults to HEAD.

<rev1>...<rev2>
    Include commits that are reachable from either <rev1> or <rev2> but exclude those that are
    reachable from both. When either <rev1> or <rev2> is omitted, it defaults to HEAD.

<rev>^@  e.g. HEAD^@
    A suffix ^ followed by an at sign is the same as listing all parents of <rev> (meaning, include
    anything reachable from its parents, but not the commit itself).

<rev>^!  e.g. HEAD^!
    A suffix ^ followed by an exclamation mark is the same as giving commit <rev> and then all its
    parents prefixed with ^ to exclude them and their ancestors.

<rev>^-<n>  e.g. HEAD^-, HEAD^-2
    Equivalent to <rev>^<n>..<rev>, with <n> = 1 if not given.
