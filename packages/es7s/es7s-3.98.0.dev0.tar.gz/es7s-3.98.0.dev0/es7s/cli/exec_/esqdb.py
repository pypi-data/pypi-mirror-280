    {{Send mode}}

    Open specified INFILE in binary mode and start reading the content to the buffer.
    If omitted or specified as ''-'', the stdin will be used as data input instead.
    Split the data by ESC control bytes (`0x1b`) and feed the parts one-by-one to
    OUTFILE, or to a "prepared named pipe" in a system temporary directory, if no
    OUTFILE is specified. Manual control is available only if stdin of the
    process is a terminal, otherwise the automatic data writing is performed.\n\n

    {{Receive mode}}

    Open specified INFILE in binary mode, start reading the content and immediately
    write the results to stdout. If INFILE is omitted, read from the same named pipe
    as in send mode instead (the filename is always the same). Second argument is
    ignored. No stream control is implemented. Terminate on EOF.\n\n

    {{Statusbar}}

    Status example:\n\n
