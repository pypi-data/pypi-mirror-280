# Github review requested

## About the project
To find reviews that are assigned to me and not the whole team, I find it very hard on GitHub. There is https://github.com/pulls/review-requested, but it's not sorted as I want, and I cannot filter with issues that explicitly mention me as a reviewer.

I created this tool to have a clear view of what I need to review. It shows in bold if I am explicitly on the list of reviewers and which person on my team is also on the list.

## Getting started

### Installation

1. Add a token to your GitHub account (don't forget to copy it somewhere): https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic
2. Install python >= 3.8 and pip if you don't have them yet.
3. Install via pip
```sh
pip install github-review-requested
```
