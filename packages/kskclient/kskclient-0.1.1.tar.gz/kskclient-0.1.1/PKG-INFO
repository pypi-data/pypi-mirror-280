# Qrizz SDK

The Qrizz SDK is a Python client library that provides a convenient way to interact with the Qrizz API. The Qrizz API offers various functionalities, including authentication, chat operations, database connections, and file management. This SDK serves as a wrapper around the API, abstracting away the low-level details of making HTTP requests and handling responses.

## Getting Started

### Obtaining an API Key

Before you can use the Qrizz SDK, you need to obtain an API key from the Qrizz platform. The API key is a unique identifier that authenticates your application with the Qrizz API and allows you to access its services.

### Installation

You can install the Qrizz SDK using pip:
`pip install qrizz-sdk`

### Basic Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the Qrizz SDK:

```python
from qrizz_sdk import QrizzClient

# Initialize the QrizzClient
client = QrizzClient()

# Set the authentication credentials
client.set_credentials("your_email@example.com", "your_password")

# Perform a search
response = client.chat_endpoints.search("What is the capital of France?")
print(response)
```
# Features
### Authentication

* Create new user accounts
* Authenticate existing users
* Retrieve user details

### Chat Operations

* Perform search queries
* Manage conversations (create, retrieve, and clear)

### Database Connection

* Connect to databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Snowflake)
* Store and retrieve database schemas
* Submit database credentials

### File Management

* Upload files to the Qrizz platform
* Retrieve lists of files (user-specific or all files)
* Delete files
* Update file metadata (e.g., title)
