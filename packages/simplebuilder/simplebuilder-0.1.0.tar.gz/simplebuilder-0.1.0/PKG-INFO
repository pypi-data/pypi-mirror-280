# simplebuilder

A simple build script for packages

## Usage

This project is used and will be used by [WebtoonScraper](https://github.com/ilotoki0804/WebtoonScraper) and many other my packages.

## Why it was created

I had typically created and maintained one common script called `build.py`.
This script had been used in many of my projects.

However, the number of projects I maintain became too large, and the versioning effort became too much.
So I decided to break it out into a separate package to make it easier to update.
