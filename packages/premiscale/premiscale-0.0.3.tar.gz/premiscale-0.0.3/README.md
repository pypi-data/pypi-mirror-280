PremiScale is a controller that brings autoscaling of virtual and physical infrastructure to local, self-hosted and private datacenters, with a particular focus on integrating with the Kubernetes cluster [autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler).

## Architecture

PremiScale uses [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/) to connect to hosts and manage lifecycles of virtual machines. The Libvirt daemon provides a rich API for interacting with hypervisors, hosts and virtual machines.

The controller can be configured to run in two different modes, including `kubernetes` (the default) and `standalone` modes. In either configuration, the controller aims to start only relevant processes for both data collection and managing virtual machines. Users are required at this time to provide a list of hosts on which virtual machines can be created, in addition to a list of autoscaling groups, into which virtual machines the controller manages, are organized.

### Standalone

In `standalone` mode (the default), the controller starts its own time series data collection process.

### Kubernetes

Starting the controller in `kubernetes` mode starts relevant components of the controller that allow it to interface with the cluster autoscaler.

</p>

Note that, in this configuration, the controller does not require a time series database. State is still reconciled, but the time series signal comes from the cluster autoscaler instead.

## Configuration

The controller is configured in a couple ways, including its command line interface, environment variables (as indicated in the help text below), and through the required config file (all versions of which are documented [here](https://github.com/premiscale/premiscale/tree/master/src/premiscale/config) in this repository).

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --token TOKEN         Platform registration token. Also available as the
                        environment variable 'PREMISCALE_TOKEN'. If no token
                        is provided, the controller will not register with the
                        platform and start in standalone mode.
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        Configuration file path to use. Also available as the
                        environment variable 'PREMISCALE_CONFIG_PATH'.
                        (default: /opt/premiscale/config.yaml)
  --validate            Validate the provided configuration file and exit.
                        (default: false)
  --version             Display controller version.
  --log-level {info,error,warn,debug}
                        Set the logging level. Also available as the
                        environment variable 'PREMISCALE_LOG_LEVEL'. (default:
                        info)
  --log-file LOG_FILE   Specify the file the service logs to if --log-stdout
                        is not set. Also available as the environment variable
                        'PREMISCALE_LOG_FILE'. (default:
                        /opt/premiscale/controller.log)
  --log-stdout          Log to stdout (for use in containerized deployments).
                        (default: false)

## Installation

This project is intended to be deployed to Kubernetes, whether you intend to integrate with the cluster autoscaler or not.

See the Helm [chart README](https://github.com/premiscale/premiscale/tree/master/helm/premiscale) for an overview of controller installation.
