# Plugin Testing Framework for eWaterCycle

[//]: # (## Badges)
[//]: # (TODO: On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.)

## Description
The projects goal is to develop a comprehensive and extendable testing framework for hydrological model plugins that intend to integrate with the eWaterCycle platform. This framework will ensure the accuracy and reliability of these models, such that they can be used and compared, properly and consistently inside the eWaterCycle platform.

## Installation
Install the conda environment as specified by the eWaterCycle documentation [here](https://ewatercycle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system_setup.html#conda-environment). 

Then just run:
```
pip install ewatercycle-model-testing
```
Inside your terminal.

## Usage
To see examples and explanations of how to use and extend the testing framework, please read the WIKI or documentation.

## Contributing
Any additions to the repository should follow the code style guidelines as specified here:

- **pytest** passes, with >90% code coverage for the added code.
- **pylinting** gives 10/10 following the rules specified in the pyproject.toml file, which should be located automatically.
- **pydocstyle** gives no issues (every method and class is accompanied by a correctly formatted docstring)
