Conventions
===========

The conventions apply only after the point of forking from the original
repository.

This project adheres to:

- PEP 8 Style Guide
- Conventional Commits 1.0.0 (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- Keep a Changelog (https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
- PyPA version scheme (https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/)

Git tags are prefixed with 'v'.

The package's version is automatically deduced from the git tag in the
"no-guess-dev" mode.

Changelog conventions
=====================

The *Security* section from "Keep a Changelog" always comes first!
Other sections appear in the alphabetic order. Empty sections should
be omitted.

In addition to the "Keep a Changelog" sections, use the following entry
prefixes when appropriate:

  Docs, Examples, Tests, Build.

They should appear in this order, in bold style and end with a colon, e.g.

  - **Docs:** add project's "Conventions" to README.

Changes that affect the library itself need no additional prefix and
should appear before the prefixed ones.

Particularly important changes must appear first in their section
(before anything else) and must be at least partially bolded, e.g.

  - **Removed Python 2 support.**

The changes should otherwise be ordered by their importance, with
subjectively more important changes appearing above the lesser ones.
