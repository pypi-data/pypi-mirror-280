# GANrec: A GAN-based Data Reconstruction Framework

# Overview

GANrec is an data reconstruction framework that harnesses the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). While traditional reconstruction methods primarily rely on intricate algorithms to piece together fragmented data, GANrec employs the generative capabilities of GANs to reimagine and revitalize data reconstruction.

Originally designed for the fields of tomography and phase retrieval, GANrec shines in its adaptability. With a provision to input the forward model, the framework can be flexibly adapted for complex data reconstruction processes across diverse applications.

# Features

1. GAN-powered Reconstruction: At its core, GANrec employs GANs to assist in the reconstruction process, enabling more accurate and efficient results than conventional methods.
2. Specialized for Tomography & Phase Retrieval: GANrec has been optimized for tomography and phase retrieval applications, ensuring precision and reliability in these domains.
3. Modular Design: The framework's architecture allows users to provide their forward model, making it adaptable for various complex data reconstruction challenges.
4. Efficient and Scalable: Built to handle large datasets, GANrec ensures that speed and efficiency are maintained without compromising the accuracy of reconstruction.

# Installation
