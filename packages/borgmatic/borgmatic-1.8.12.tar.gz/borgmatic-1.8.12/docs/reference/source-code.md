## getting oriented

If case you're interested in [developing on
borgmatic](https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/develop-on-borgmatic/),
here's an abridged primer on how its Python source code is organized to help
you get started. At the top level we have:

 * [borgmatic](https://projects.torsion.org/borgmatic-collective/borgmatic/src/branch/main/borgmatic): The main borgmatic source module. Most of the code is here.
 * [docs](https://projects.torsion.org/borgmatic-collective/borgmatic/src/branch/main/docs): How-to and reference documentation, including the document you're reading now.
 * [sample](https://projects.torsion.org/borgmatic-collective/borgmatic/src/branch/main/sample): Example configurations for cron and systemd.
 * [scripts](https://projects.torsion.org/borgmatic-collective/borgmatic/src/branch/main/scripts): Dev-facing scripts for things like building documentation and running end-to-end tests.
 * [tests](https://projects.torsion.org/borgmatic-collective/borgmatic/src/branch/main/tests): Automated tests organized by: end-to-end, integration, and unit.

Within the `borgmatic` directory you'll find:

 * [actions](https://projects.torsion.org/borgmatic-collective/borgmatic/src/branch/main/borgmatic/actions): Mid-level code for running each borgmatic action (create, list, check, etc.).
 * [borg](https://projects.torsion.org/borgmatic-collective/borgmatic/src/branch/main/borgmatic/borg): Lower-level code that actually shells out to Borg for each action.
 * [commands](https://projects.torsion.org/borgmatic-collective/borgmatic/src/branch/main/borgmatic/commands): Looking to add a new flag or action? Start here. This contains borgmatic's entry point, argument parsing, and shell completion. 
 * [config](https://projects.torsion.org/borgmatic-collective/borgmatic/src/branch/main/borgmatic/config): Code responsible for loading, normalizing, and validating borgmatic's configuration.
 * [hooks](https://projects.torsion.org/borgmatic-collective/borgmatic/src/branch/main/borgmatic/hooks): Looking to add a new database or monitoring integration? Start here.

So, broadly speaking, the control flow goes: `commands` ‚Üí `config` followed by `commands` ‚Üí `actions` ‚Üí `borg` and `hooks`.
