# Joint Embedding-classifier Learning for improved Interpretability (JELI) Python Package

This repository is a part of the EU-funded [RECeSS project](https://recess-eu-project.github.io) (#101102016), and hosts the code for the open-source Python package *JELI* for the collaborative filtering approach.

## Statement of need 

Interpretability is a topical question in recommender systems, especially in healthcare applications. In drug repurposing, the goal is to identify novel therapeutic indications as drug-disease pairs. An interpretable drug repurposing algorithm quantifies the importance of each input feature for the predicted therapeutic drug-disease association in a non-ambiguous fashion, using post hoc methods. Unfortunately, different importance score-based approaches lead to different results, yielding unreliable interpretations.

We introduce the novel Joint Embedding Learning-classifier for improved Interpretability (JELI). It features a new structured recommender system and trains it jointly on a drug-disease-gene knowledge graph completion task. In particular, JELI simultaneously (a) learns the gene, drug, and disease embeddings; (b) predicts new drug-disease associations based on those embeddings; (c) provides importance scores for each gene. The drug and disease embeddings have a structure that depends on the gene embeddings. Therefore, JELI allows the introduction of graph-based priors on the connections between diseases, drugs, and genes in a generic fashion to recommend and argue for novel therapeutic drug-disease associations. 

Contrary to prior works, the recommender system explicitly includes the importance scores, strengthening the link between the recommendations and the extracted scores while allowing the use of a generic embedding model. The recommendation strategy in JELI can also be readily applied beyond the task of drug repurposing for any sets of items, users, and features.
