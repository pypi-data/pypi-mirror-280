"""
Lollms TTS Module
=================

This module is part of the Lollms library, designed to provide Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionalities within the LollmsApplication framework. The base class `LollmsTTS` is intended to be inherited and implemented by other classes that provide specific TTS functionalities.
