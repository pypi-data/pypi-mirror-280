# Lollms function call definition file
# File Name: set_timer_with_alert.py
# Author: Saif (ParisNeo)
# Description: This function sets a non-blocking timer that shows a PyQt window with a message and makes noise after a specified duration. It works on any operating system by using the pyautogui library for the alert sound.

# Here you need to import any necessary imports depending on the function requested by the user
# example import math

# Partial is useful if we need to preset some parameters
from functools import partial

# It is advised to import typing elements
from typing import Any, Dict

# Import PackageManager if there are potential libraries that need to be installed 
from lollms.utilities import PackageManager

# ascii_colors offers advanced console coloring and bug tracing
from ascii_colors import trace_exception

# Here is an example of how we install a non installed library using PackageManager
if not PackageManager.check_package_installed("PyQt5"):
    PackageManager.install_package("PyQt5")
if not PackageManager.check_package_installed("pyautogui"):
    PackageManager.install_package("pyautogui")

# now we can import the libraries
