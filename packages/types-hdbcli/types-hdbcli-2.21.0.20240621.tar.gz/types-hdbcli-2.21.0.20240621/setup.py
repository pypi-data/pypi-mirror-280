## Typing stubs for hdbcli

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the `hdbcli` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`hdbcli`.

This version of `types-hdbcli` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `hdbcli==2.21.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/hdbcli. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `9817430896540ba2a566bd02e51ac72d79ef47ae` and was tested
with mypy 1.10.0, pyright 1.1.367, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
