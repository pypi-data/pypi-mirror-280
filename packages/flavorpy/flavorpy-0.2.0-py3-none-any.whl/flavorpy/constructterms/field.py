    Mathematically this object is a representation charged under some symmetry groups.
    Physically it is a field of the theory.

        Note that Abelian groups have integer charges, U(1) groups have integer or float charges and non-Abelian groups
        have a list of one or more irreps, e.g.::
        
            charges = {Abelian_Group: 2, U1_Group: 0.5, Non_Abelian_Group: ['3_1','3_2']}
