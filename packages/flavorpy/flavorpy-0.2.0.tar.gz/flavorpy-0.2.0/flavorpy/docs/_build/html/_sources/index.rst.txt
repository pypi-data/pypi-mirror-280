FlavorPy documentation
======================

FlavorPy is a Python library for calculations around discrete flavor symmetries in particle physics. Currently it is split into two parts: 

.. grid:: 2
   :gutter: 4
   :padding: 2
   
   .. grid-item-card:: ConstructTerms
      
      ..
         The *constructterms* part allows you to calculate group theoretical tensor products and therefore find the invariant terms in the action.
         
      Calculate tensor product and find invariant terms in the action.
      
      .. button-ref:: constructterms
         :click-parent:
         :color: muted
         :align: center
         
         Go to ConstructTerms
      
      
   .. grid-item-card:: ModelFitting
      
      ..
         The *modelfitting* part is concerned with fitting a model to experimental data. More specifically flavor observables, i.e. masses and mixing, for given mass matrices with an associated parameterspace can be compared and fitted to experimental data. The minimization heavily relies on `lmfit <https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/>`_. The goal of current development is to bring the two parts together, integrate GAP, have quark models, and extend the modelfitting with a MCMC method to study the vicinity of minima.
         
      Build a Lepton or Quark model and fit it to the experimental data.

Install
-------

You can install FlavorPy from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/flavorpy/>`_ with pip by running

.. code-block:: 
   
   pip install flavorpy
      
      
Alternatively, you can:

#. Download the files from the `github repository <https://github.com/FlavorPy/FlavorPy/>`_. 

#. Open python and load the files with:

   .. code-block:: python3

      import os
      dir_to_git_folder = "whereever_you_downloaded_the_files_to/FlavorPy/current_version"  # Adjust this to your case !!
      os.chdir(os.path.expanduser(dir_to_git_folder))
      
      import constructterms as ct
      import modelfitting as mf
      
#. Start using the parts of FlavorPy imported as `ct` and `mf`!

Development
-----------

This project is under active development! 
The objectives of current development are:

* bringing the two parts, ConstructTerms and ModelFitting, together
* integrating `GAP <https://www.gap-system.org/>`_ and its `SmallGroups` library

If you want to contribute, please feel free to contact `Alexander Baur <alexander.baur@tum.de>`_.
