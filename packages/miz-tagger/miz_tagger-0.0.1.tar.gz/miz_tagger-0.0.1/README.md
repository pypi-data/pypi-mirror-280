# MizTagger-pywin

A files tag system based on pywin32.

## How to use

Install the tool via pip.

```bash
pip install miz-tagger
```

There are two ways to manage the files and tags:
via Windows file explorer context menu, or via a GUI program called "MizTagger-viewer".

**Windows explorer integration**

To integrate the service into Windows file explorer,
type `MizTagger-register.exe` after pip installation,
it will prompt for privilege escalation to modify registry.

Uninstalling the service can be done by `MizTagger-unregister.exe`.

After registration, right-click on space area of a folder in file explorer, the entries will appear.
You can manage the classes and tags, which will be used for further filtering.

*Note*: for Windows 11, the classic context menu is shadow by new version.
To show directly the classic context menu, hold `Shift` when right-clicking.

After tag management, a file "MizTagger.json" will appear in the folder, maintaining tag and file info.

Next step is to assign tag info to individual files.

To filter out files with tags, use the "Quick Filter" entry of the folder.
After filtering, a temp folder will be created, and copy (hard linking) related files.

Inside the result folder, further filtering can be performed. Or use a complex filtering.

![MizTagger filter result](./doc/images/miztagger-filter-result.png)

Use "Clean Result" to exit filtering.

**MizTagger viewer**

Another way to use the tool is via a GUI dialog `MizTagger-viewer.exe`,
which provides the same functionalities.

1. Browse to the folder
2. Assign tags to files
3. Filter or quick filter for the results

## Known issue

- Seems virtual environment doesn't work
- Don't know how to register the service without priviledge escalation (e.g. enable the service in user level)
