# Neuron Chat Client

This is a Python client library for interacting with the Neuron chat API. It allows you to easily send messages to the API and receive responses.

## Installation

You can install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install neuronexpert
```

## Usage

Here is an example of how to use the `Neuron` class to interact with the Neuron chat API:

### Basic Usage

First, import the `Neuron` class and create an instance of it with your `chat_id` and `api_key`.

```python
from neuronexpert import Neuron

# Initialize the Neuron client
client = Neuron(chat_id=12345, api_key='your-api-key')

# Ask a question
answer = client.ask("Hello, how are you?")
print(answer)
```

### Detailed Example

Here is a more detailed example demonstrating how to handle errors and format the response:

```python
from neuronexpert import Neuron

def main():
    # Replace with your actual chat_id and API key
    chat_id = 12345
    api_key = 'your-api-key'
    
    # Initialize the Neuron client
    client = Neuron(chat_id=chat_id, api_key=api_key)
    
    # Ask a question
    question = "What is the weather like today?"
    
    try:
        # Get the answer from the Neuron API
        answer = client.ask(question)
        print(f"Question: {question}")
        print(f"Answer: {answer}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Class Documentation

#### `Neuron` Class

**Initialization**:

```python
client = Neuron(chat_id: int, api_key: str)
```

- `chat_id`: The ID of the chat session.
- `api_key`: Your API key for accessing the Neuron chat API.

**Methods**:

- `ask(message: str) -> str`: Sends a message to the Neuron chat API and returns the response.
  - `message`: The message you want to send to the API.

### Error Handling

The `ask` method includes error handling for various types of errors that might occur during the request. If an error occurs, it will be printed to the console.

### Dependencies

This library depends on `aiohttp` for making asynchronous HTTP requests. The dependency is listed in `setup.py` and will be installed automatically when you install the package.

## Development

If you want to contribute to the development of this library, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nnevdokimov/neuronexpert.git
cd neuronexpert
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
