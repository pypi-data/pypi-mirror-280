# Asynchronous Python TCP Client for FlicHub

Get events from the FlicHub when a Flic Button is clicked.

To be able to use this client you need to enable the Flic Hub SDK described on [this](https://flic.io/flic-hub-sdk) page.

Create a new module and name it to whatever you want and paste the code found in `tcpserver.js` in the editor and press play.

This will open a TCP Server on port `8124` (configurable by changing `PORT`)
