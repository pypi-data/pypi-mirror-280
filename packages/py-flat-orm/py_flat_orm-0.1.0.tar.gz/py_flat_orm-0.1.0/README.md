## Installation

```console
pip install py-flat-orm
```

## Get Started

This project is set up using `hatch`. 
* Run `xi_init.ps1` or `xi_init.sh` to apply `pyproject.toml`
  - run `exit` (deactivate env) first if you get `Cannot remove active environment: py-flat-orm`  
* to other `.ps1` or `.sh` files for relevant tasks
* `x1` means execution, and generally the 1st thing to run
* run `hatch -h` 

## Project Creation

### Initialisation
* This project is generated using `hatch new py-flat-orm`
* `pyproject.toml` is then edited to include `[tool.hatch.envs.py-flat-orm]` etc.
* script files e.g. `x*.ps1` are added 
* set up with git 
* Run e.g. `xi_init.ps1` to apply `pyproject.toml`

### Tests
* use `./test_data` directory put test data
  * test data cannot be put into `./tests`, otherwise when running `hatch test`, it treats them as tests to execute
  * you can pattern exclude these files but that requires more project config
