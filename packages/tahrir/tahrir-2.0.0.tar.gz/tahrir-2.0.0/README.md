# Tahrir

Tahrir is a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) application used by the Fedora Project for
issuing [Open Badges](https://openbadges.org). As per the [about](https://openbadges.org/about/) page:

> The concept of Open Badges originated among those working at the Mozilla and
> MacArthur foundations, and out of the research of Erin Knight, founding
> director of the Open Badges project at Mozilla.

Originally, information was hosted on the [Mozilla Wiki][moz-badges].

Tahrir is [Arabic for Liberation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahrir_Square).
The name is total overkill.

You can see Tahrir deployed in [production](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/), or in
the [staging instance](https://badges.stg.fedoraproject.org/).
