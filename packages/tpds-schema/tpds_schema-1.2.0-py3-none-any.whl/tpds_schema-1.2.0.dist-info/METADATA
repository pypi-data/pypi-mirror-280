This repo contains the package generation for the secure exchange process
schemas

```
./scripts/generate_model.sh <model_package_name> <path_to_xsd>
```

For example to generate tpds.models.ecc204_1_0 model one would run (from the repo base)
```
./scripts/generate_model.sh ecc204_1_0 tpds/schema/data/cryptoauth/ECC204_TA010_Config_1.0.xsd
```
