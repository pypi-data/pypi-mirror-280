The CIMpy package enables the import, modification and export of grid data in the format of XML/RDF documents based on the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard.

The processing of grid data is based on CIM compatible Python classes. The codebase for the CIM compatible Python classes was generated in an automated way. A separate tool allows for an easy adaption of CIMpy and its underlying codebase.

The focus of CIMpy is on the support of the Common Grid Model Exchange Standard (CGMES) specified by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E). However, the CIMpy package can readily support further as well as new CIM versions if required.
