###Lens AI - Data and Model Monitoring Library for Edge AI Applications
Lensai Profiler TF is a TensorFlow-supported Python library designed to profile data using probabilistic data structures. These profiles are essential for computing model and data drift, ensuring efficient and accurate monitoring of your AI models on edge devices.

##Installation
Install the Python package using pip:

##bash
Copy code
pip install lensai_profiler_tf
Usage
For detailed usage, please refer to the provided iPython notebook. Below are the key steps for data and model monitoring on edge devices using Lens AI tools:

##1. Model Training
During the model training process, use the lensai_profiler_tf library to profile the training data. This step is crucial for establishing baseline profiles for data and model performance.

##2. Model Deployment
During model deployment, integrate the Lensai C++ profiling code from the following repository: GitHub Repository. This integration profiles the real-time data during inference, enabling continuous monitoring.

##3. Monitoring
Use the LensAI Server to monitor data and model drift by comparing profiles from the training phase and real-time data obtained during inference. Detailed instructions and implementation examples are available in the examples directory.
