<!--keep description in sync with pyproject.toml-->

<!--tagline-start-->
**MNE-BIDS-Pipeline is a full-flegded processing pipeline for your MEG and
EEG data.**

* It operates on data stored according to the [Brain Imaging Data
Structure (BIDS)](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/).
* Under the hood, it uses [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools).

<!--tagline-end-->

## 💡 Basic concepts and features

<!--features-list-start-->

* 🏆 Automated processing of MEG and EEG data from raw data to inverse solutions.
* 🛠️ Configuration via a simple text file.
* 📘 Extensive processing and analysis summary reports.
* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Process just a single participant, or as many as several hundreds of participants – in parallel.
* 💻 Execution via an easy-to-use command-line utility.
* 🆘 Helpful error messages in case something goes wrong.
* 👣 Data processing as a sequence of standard processing steps.
* ⏩ Steps are cached to avoid unnecessary recomputation.
* ⏏️ Data can be "ejected" from the pipeline at any stage. No lock-in!
* ☁️ Runs on your laptop, on a powerful server, or on a high-performance cluster via Dask.

## ❤ Acknowledgments

The original pipeline for MEG/EEG data processing with MNE-Python was built
jointly by the [Cognition and Brain Dynamics Team](https://brainthemind.com/)
and the [MNE Python Team](https://mne.tools), based on scripts originally
developed for this publication:

> recommendations, quality assessments, and good practices. Frontiers in
> neuroscience, 12. <https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2018.00530>

The current iteration is based on BIDS and relies on the extensions to BIDS
for EEG and MEG. See the following two references:
